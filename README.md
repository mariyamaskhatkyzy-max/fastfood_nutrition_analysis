# Fast Food Nutrition Analysis
This project analyzes nutritional information from 515 menu items across eight major U.S. fast-food chains. The goal is to identify differences in calories, fat, sugar, and other nutritional metrics using exploratory data analysis and statistical tests.

## Methods Used
- Summary statistics & descriptive analysis
- Data visualization (histograms, boxplots, scatterplots)
- ANOVA to compare restaurants
- Tukey HSD post-hoc tests
- Correlation analysis (Pearson) between sugar and total fat
- Linear regression modeling to predict calories from fat, sugar, protein, sodium, and carbs

## Tools
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- SciPy, Statsmodels
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
Fast food nutrition dataset from Kaggle:  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/fastfood-nutrition

I cleaned and analyzed the data to understand how nutritional profiles differ across restaurants and how sugar and fat are related.
