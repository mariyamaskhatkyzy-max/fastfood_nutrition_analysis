## Fast Food Nutrition Analysis

This project analyzes nutritional information from 515 menu items across eight major U.S. fast-food chains. The goal is to identify differences in calories, fat, sugar, and other nutrition metrics through exploratory analysis and statistical testing.

## Methods Used

Summary statistics & descriptive analysis

Data visualization (histograms, boxplots, scatterplots)

ANOVA to compare restaurants

Tukey HSD post-hoc tests

Pearson correlation between sugar and total fat

Linear regression to predict calories from fat, sugar, protein, sodium, and carbs

## Tools

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)

SciPy, Statsmodels

Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset

Fast Food Nutrition dataset from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/fastfood-nutrition

The dataset was cleaned and analyzed to compare nutritional profiles across restaurants and to examine how fat and sugar relate to each other and to overall calorie levels.
